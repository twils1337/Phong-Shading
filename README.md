#Ray Tracing and Phong Shading
In this project, I implemented the Phong shading algorithm utilizing ray tracing.
This project was done for my CS130: Computer Graphics class. This project was built 
on CentOS, but should work on any Unix/Linux OS given that GLUT is installed and the program 
has all the correct paths to OpenGL/GLUT. It was built on top of my previous project that utilized the 
Loop Subdivision algorithm (https://github.com/twils1337/CPP/tree/master/Loop_Subdivision).
